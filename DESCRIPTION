Description: code for implementing gaussian process regression, including visualizing for uncertainty measuar At the same time, the package can be used to make predictions under three different scenatios:(i) temporal prediction: predicting case counts for future time periods, leading to predicting outcome for each location in the future(ii)spatial prediction: predicting case counts for unseen locations, leading to predicting outcome spread within the same time frame in other locations(iii) spatiotemporal prediction: predicting case counts for unseen location and future time period pairs, leading to predicting outcome spread to new locations in the future
